# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

## Introduction
It all starts with counting how many prime number exists in the universe, i.e. $$\lbrace 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... \rbrace,$$
the answer is 'infinitely many' (see Euclid's proof)!
<p/>
If we take a look at number $n$, and we use a function $\pi(n)$ to describe how many primes smaller than or equal to $n$ are there, then this function is called the prime counting function. For example, $\pi(10)$ $=count$ $prime$ $\leq 10$ $=count$ $\lbrace$ $2, 3, 5, 7$ $\rbrace$ $=4$.

Gauss and Legendre gave the approximation of $\pi(n)$ as it gets to $+\infty$, namely $$\frac{x}{log(x)}$$

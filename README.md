# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

It all starts with counting how many prime number exists in the universe, i.e., {2,3,5,7,11,...}, the answer is: infinitely many (see Euclid's proof)!
<br/>
But how? If we get a number $n$, how many primes smaller than $n$, denote by $p(n)$ are there?
This is the so called Prime Counting Function.
Gauss and Legendre gave

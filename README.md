# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

## Introduction
It all starts with counting how many prime number exists in the universe, i.e. $$\lbrace 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... \rbrace$$
the answer is: infinitely many (see Euclid's proof)!
<p/>
If we get a number $n$, to see how many primes smaller than $n$ are there, we use a function $\pi(n)$ to describe it, this is the so called prime counting function, for example, Gauss and Legendre gave

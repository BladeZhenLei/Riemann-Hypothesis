# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

It all starts with counting how many prime numbers exist in the universe, i.e. $$p=\lbrace 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... \rbrace,$$
the answer is <strong>Infinitely many</strong> (see Euclid's proof)!
<p/>
If we take a look at number $n$, and we use a function $\pi(n)$ to describe how many primes are there smaller than or equal to $n$, then this function is called the prime counting function. For example, $\pi(10)$ $=count$ $prime$ $\leq 10$ $=count$ $\lbrace$ $2, 3, 5, 7$ $\rbrace$ $=4$.
<p/>
Gauss and Legendre gave the approximation of $\pi(n)$ as $n$ gets to $+\infty$, by observing the shape of $\pi(n)$
namley 
$$\pi(n)\sim\frac{n}{log(n)},$$
meaning that $\pi(n)$ is proportional, or more precisely, asymptotic to $\frac{n}{log(n)},$
in the sense
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\pi(n)}{\frac{n}{log(n)}} = 1.$$
The plot below shows $\pi(n)$ $vs.$ $\frac{n}{log(n)}$

and we call this the <strong>Prime Number Theorem (PNT).</strong>

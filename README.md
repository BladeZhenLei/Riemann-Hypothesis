# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

## Introduction
It all starts with counting how many prime number exists in the universe, i.e. $$\lbrace 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... \rbrace$$
the answer is: infinitely many (see Euclid's proof)!
<p/>
If we look at a number $n$, to see how many primes smaller than $n$ are there, we use the function $\pi(n)$ to describe it, this is the so called prime counting function. For example, $\pi(10)=countprime \leq 10=count\brace2, 3, 5, 7\rbrace=4$.

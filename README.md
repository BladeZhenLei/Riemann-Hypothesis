# Riemann Hypothesis in a Nutshell

## Introduction
It all starts with counting how many prime number exists in the universe, i.e. ${ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... \} $
\begin{align*}
 \hspace{3.5cm} x_1 &\equiv 1 \pmod{3} = \big\{4, 7, 10, 13, 16, ...\big\},\\
 \hspace{3.5cm} x_2 &\equiv 2 \pmod{5} = \big\{7, 12, 17, 22, 27, ...\big\},\\
 \hspace{3.5cm} x_3 &\equiv 3 \pmod{7} = \big\{10, 17, 24, 31, 38, ...\big\},\\
 \vdots \hspace{-2.8cm}\\
 \hspace{3.5cm} \big\{x_n\big\} &\equiv n\pmod{2n+1} =\big\{\big\{3n+1\big\}, \big\{5n+2\big\}, \big\{7n+3\big\}, ...\big\},
\end{align*}
the answer is: infinitely many (see Euclid's proof)!
<p/>
If we get a number $n$, to see how many primes smaller than $n$ are there, we use a function $\pi(n)$ to describe it, this is the so called prime counting function, for example, Gauss and Legendre gave
